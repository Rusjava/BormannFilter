        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div>The primary function Borrmann filter application is to simulate
        propagation of X-ray radiation through thin symmetric and asymmetric 
        crystals. The application can display rocking curves as function of the energy
        or incidence angle of both reflected and transmitted radiation for both 
        Bragg and Laue geometries.</div>
