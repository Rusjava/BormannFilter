            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The primary purpose of the Borrmann filter application is to simulate
                propagation of X-ray radiation through thin symmetric as well as asymmetric 
                crystals. The application can display rocking curves as function of the energy
                or incidence angle of both reflected and transmitted radiation for 
                Bragg and Laue geometries and both s- and p-polarizations.</p>
            <p>In addition, the application can transform a binary Shadow file
                containing rays incident on a thin Borrmann crystal into a new Shadow binary 
                files containing rays after passing through a thin Borrmann crystal. The 
                applications adjusts the electrical fields and phases for both polarizations.

            <h3>Calculating rocking curves</h3>
            <p>
                To display rocking curves, enter scattering factors f<sub>1</sub>
                and f<sub>2</sub>, molar mass of the crystal material, density, 
                inter-plane distance, cutting angle and crystal thickness. The 
                rocking curves can be drawn as either function of X-ray energy or
                incidence angle and either incidence angle or X-ray energy must be
                specified, respectively.                    
            </p>
            <p>
                To create the graph, press the <i>Calculate</i> button and observe the
                result in the pane below. The type of the geometry: Bragg or Laue 
                as well as energy or angular range will be determined automatically. In 
                the Graph parameters box the relative scale of the X-axis can be selected a
                s well the polarization displayed. To recalculate the graph with changed 
                scale and/or for different polarization press <i>Calculate</i> button again.
