            <p>The primary purpose of the Borrmann filter application is to simulate
                propagation of X-ray radiation through thin symmetric as well as asymmetric 
                crystals. The application can display rocking curves as function of the energy
                or incidence angle of both reflected and transmitted radiation for 
                Bragg and Laue geometries and both s- and p-polarizations.</p>
            <p>In addition, the application can transform a binary Shadow file
                containing rays incident on a thin Borrmann crystal into a new Shadow binary 
                files containing rays after passing through a thin Borrmann crystal. The 
                applications adjusts the electrical fields and phases for both polarizations.

            <h3 class="boxtitle">Calculating rocking curves</h3>
            <p>
                To display rocking curves, enter scattering factors f<sub>1</sub>
                and f<sub>2</sub>, molar mass M of the crystal material, density &rho;, 
                inter-plane distance d, cutting angle and crystal thickness. The 
                rocking curves can be drawn as either function of X-ray energy or
                incidence angle and either incidence angle or X-ray energy must be
                specified, respectively.                    
            </p>
            <p>
                To create the graph, press the <i>Calculate</i> button and observe the
                result in the pane below. The type of the geometry: Bragg or Laue 
                as well as energy or angular range will be determined automatically. In 
                the Graph parameters box the relative scale of the X-axis can be selected a
                s well the polarization displayed. To recalculate the graph with changed 
                scale and/or for different polarization press <i>Calculate</i> button again.

            <h3 class="boxtitle">Saving the results of calculations</h3>
            <p>
                To save the graph as a text file, press the <i>Save</i> button and choose the file
                name of text file.

            <h3 class="boxtitle">Setting up additional graph parameters</h3>
            <p>
                To change the optional graph parameters select the <i>Options/Graph parameters...</i>
                item from the main menu. Then enter the size of the graph in points and set whether the 
                X range of the graph is determined automatically. If the manual range selection is chosen,
                enter the X range of the graph in eV or radians.

            <h3 class="boxtitle">Processing Shadow files</h3>
            <p>
                The application allows one to apply a Borrmann filter to a binary Shadow file. As a result
                a new Shadow binary file is formed where the electrical field values and phases for one or
                both polarizations are adjusted as though the X-ray radiation propagated through a thin
                Borrmann crystal taking into account incidence angles and photon energies. To apply the 
                filter select <i>Shadow/Filter...</i> from the main menu. To change the filtering parameters
                select <i>Shadow/Parameters...</i> from the main menu and enter the maximum number of rays
                processed and the polarization to which the filter is applied.

                To save the graph as an image, select <i>File/Save as image...</i> from the main menu.
                The available image formats are <b>jpg</b>, <b>tiff</b>, <b>gif</b> and <b>bmp</b>. The image saving parameters can
                be changed using <i>Options/Image parameters...</i> where the image size and other parameters can 
                be selected. The graph can be printed using <i>File/Save as image...</i> from the main
                menu. The page options can be selected using <i>Options/Page setup...</i> from the same
                menu. The access the information about the application, use <i>Help</i> menu.
